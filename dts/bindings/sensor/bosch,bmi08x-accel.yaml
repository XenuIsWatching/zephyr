properties:
    int-gpios:
      type: phandle-array
      required: false
      description: |
        This property specifies the connection for INT, because the
        Zephyr driver maps all interrupts to INT.  The signal defaults
        to output low when produced by the sensor.

    int1-map-io:
      type: int
      required: false

        Bit[0]: Map Interrupt A to INT1, Accel Data Ready
        Bit[1]: Map Interrupt B to INT1
        Bit[2]: Map Interrupt C to INT1

    int2-map-io:
      type: int
      required: false
      description: |
        Bit[0]: Map Interrupt A to INT2, Accel Data Ready
        Bit[1]: Map Interrupt B to INT2
        Bit[2]: Map Interrupt C to INT2

        Bit[0]: reserved
        Bit[1]: if set to 1, INT1 is active high, otherwise it's active low
        Bit[2]: if set to 1, INT1 is open-drain, otherwise it's push-pull
        Bit[3]: if set to 1, enable INT1 as an output pin
        Bit[4]: if set to 1, enable INT1 as an input pin
        Bit[7:5] : reserved
